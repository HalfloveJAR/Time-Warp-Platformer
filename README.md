## About
Time Warp Platformer is a 2D platformer I'm currently developing in Godot 4 as a work-in-progress project. I'm using it as a way to learn more about the Godot engine and game development overall. I do plan to complete and release it for free eventually, but progress is slow since it's just a hobby and passion project for me right now.
